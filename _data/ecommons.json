   "abstract": "<p>Efficient RDF, graph based queries are becoming more pertinent based on the increased interest in data analytics and its intersection with large, unstructured but connected data. Many commercial systems have adopted distributed RDF graph systems in order to handle increasing dataset sizes and complex queries. This paper introduces a distribute graph approach to pre-processing linked data. Instead of traversing the memory graph, our system indexes pre-processed join elements that are organized in a graph structure. We analyze the Dbpedia data-set (derived from the Wikipedia corpus) and compare our access method to the graph traversal access approach which we also devise. Results show from our experiments that the distributed, pre-processed graph approach to accessing linked data is faster than the traversal approach over a specific range of linked queries.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>This paper presents a simple ABM simulation that seeks to provide insight into the public health benefits that derive from greater collaboration among health care professionals. In particular, the paper compares the efficiency, delivery and timeliness of health care diagnostics under two contrasting paradigms–one in which collaboration is encouraged, and an- other where it is not. The preliminary results of this study suggest that while the effect of cooperation on aggregate public health depends on the patient search algorithm employed, its effect on overall efficiency and timeliness of health care diagnostics and treatment is significant and pos- itive. Since the speed with which an adequate diagnosis is provided has implications both for the overall cost of health care, as well as for the pos- sible gains from treatment and intervention (or even for the containing of contagious disease) the results appear relevant for anyone concerned with the planning and provision of health and health care.</p>",

Among all factors that contribute to this development, datasets with labels play crucial roles. Several datasets are widely reused for investigating and analyzing different solutions in machine learning. Many systems, such as autonomous vehicles, rely on components using machine learning for recognizing objects. This paper compares different visual datasets and frameworks for machine learning. The comparison is both qualitative and quantitative and investigates object detection labels with respect to size, location, and contextual information. This paper also presents a new approach creating datasets using real-time, geo-tagged visual data, greatly improving the contextual information of the data. The data could be automatically labeled by cross-referencing information from other sources (such as weather).</p>",

Advances in this area have often been closely involved in social and political transformations. While the contemporary period is often referred to by such names as the Computing and Information Age, this is the culmination of a series of historical transformations that have been centuries in the making. This course will provide a venue for students to learn about history through the evolution of number systems and arithmetic, calculating and computing machines, and advanced communication technology via the Internet. Students who take this course will attain a degree of technological literacy while studying core historical concepts. Students who complete this course will learn the key vocabulary of the computing discipline, which is playing a significant role in modern human thought and new media communications. The History of Computing will be organized around the historical perspective. The relationships between social organization, intellectual climate, and technology will be examined and stressed.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>The E-Carrel project aims to address the preservation of, access to, and re-uses of humanities electronic text files. It enables dynamic, growing resource projects as repositories for new knowledge. It provides for on-line distributed data and tools that are open to new scholarly enhancement through a user friendly tagging tool, sophisticated use of stand-off markup and annotation (leveraging RDF capabilities), and a browsing system anyone can use. It creates a secure system of text preparation and dissemination that encourages collaboration and participation by anyone interested in the texts. To insure the endurance of authenticated texts, multiple copies are distributed on the Internet. Foundation texts anchor a system for maintaining and growing project usefulness beyond the originators’ interest and the functions they imagined. Increasing access to humanities texts as useful, adaptable, reliable source materials that can be re-purposed will increase interest in continued maintenance, which are critical for long-term preservation and access.</p>",

Start by understanding  how threading and concurrency can be used to solve a wide variety of  performance problems, enabling the construction of more powerful  networked applications. Master the Java 2 Threads classes, including  daemon threads, thread control, scheduling, and more. Review the key  problems of parallelism -- including deadlocks, race conditions, and  synchronization -- and discover proven techniques for avoiding or  resolving them. Finally, master advanced techniques for building  optimized concurrent code, including Java monitors, parallel execution  of subroutines in shared memory, and parallelizing loops.</p>",

Specifically, we have designed and  implemented a suite of multi-platform (desktop/laptop, handheld, and  browser) applications to enhance the teaching of South Asian languages  such as Hindi-Urdu. Such languages are very difficult to learn, let  alone write, and H/W devices (with their handwriting/drawing  capabilities) can play a significant role in overcoming the learning  curve. The initial application suite includes a character/word tracer, a  word splitter/joiner, a smart flashcard with audio, contextual  augmented stories for reading comprehension, and a poetic metronome. We  have received preliminary user feedback and are planning to conduct more  formal experiments to test the effectiveness of our applications. To  facilitate building ubiquitous learning communities, we are planning to  enhance our existing applications to leverage wireless connectivity, as  well as identify additional applications that will benefit from this  capability.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>We use the term <em>ubiquitous supercomputing</em> to refer to systems  that integrate low- and mid-range computing systems, advanced networks  and remote high-end computers with the goal of enhancing the  computational power accessible from local environments. Such systems  promise to enable new applications in areas as diverse as smart  instruments and collaborative environments. However, they also demand  tools for transporting code between computers and for establishing  flexible, dynamic communication structures. In this article, we propose  that these requirements be satisfied by introducing Java classes that  implement the global pointer and remote service request mechanisms  defined by a communication library called Nexus. Java supports  transportable code; Nexus provides communication support and represents  the core communication framework for Globus, a project building  infrastructure for ubiquitous supercomputing. We explain how this  NexusJava library is implemented and illustrate its use with examples.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>Aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) is evolving as an important step beyond existing software development approaches such as object-oriented development. An aspect is a module that captures a crosscutting concern, behavior that cuts across different units of abstraction in a software application; expressed as a module, such behavior can be enabled and disabled transparently and non-invasively, without changing the application code itself. Increasing industry demand for expertise in AOSD gives rise to the pedagogical challenge of covering this methodology and its foundations in the computer science curriculum. We present our curricular initiative to incorporate a novel course in AOSD in the undergraduate computer science curriculum at the intermediate level. We also discuss recent and planned efforts to integrate coverage of AOSD into existing courses.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>For concurrent I/O operations, atomicity defines the results in the overlapping file regions simultaneously read/written by requesting processes. Atomicity has been well studied at the file system level, such as POSIX standard. In this paper, we investigate the problems arising from the implementation of MPI atomicity for concurrent overlapping write access and provide a few programming solutions. Since the MPI definition of atomicity differs from the POSIX one, an implementation that simply relies on the POSIX file systems does not guarantee correct MPI semantics. To have a correct implementation of atomic I/O in MPI, we examine the efficiency of three approaches: 1) file locking, 2) graph-coloring, and 3) process-rank ordering. Performance complexity for these methods are analyzed and their experimental results are presented for file systems including NFS, SGI’s XFS, and IBM’s GPFS.</p>",

We start with Bill Feiereisen's discussion of science on the Web and what it could mean for CiSE (\"Are We There Yet?\") and end with George Thiruvathukal's discussion of the challenges therein (\"If We Build It, Will They Come?\"). CiSE's official homepage is www.computer.org/cise; we gladly welcome comments with suggestions or feedback. You can contact lead editor (Jenny Stout; jstout@computer.org) or write to either Bill or George (their email addresses appear at the end of their respective essays).</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>In this article, the authors explore various uses of inexpensive embedded Linux devices such as the Linksys NSLU2 (\"slug\"). Embedded computing is a topic of growing interest. Although novel architectures such as cell processors, graphics processors (GPUs), and FPGAs are growing in popularity, conventional microproessor designs such as Intel's Xscale (ARM) and Atom pack a punch in a small footprint, not to mention being widely supported by commodity operating system and development tools. We're convinced that this entire space is a tool worth keeping in the scientific programmer's and software developer's toolchests.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>Scalable atomic and parallel access to noncontiguous regions of a file is essential to exploit high performance I/O as required by large-scale applications. Parallel I/O frameworks such as MPI I/O conceptually allow I/O to be defined on regions of a file using derived datatypes. Access to regions of a file can be automatically computed on a perprocessor basis using the datatype, resulting in a list of (offset, length) pairs. We describe three approaches for implementing lock serving (whole file, region locking, and byterange locking) and compare the various approaches using three noncontiguous I/O benchmarks. We present the details of the lock server architecture and describe the implementation of a fully-functional prototype that makes use of a lightweight message passing library and red/black trees.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System,by Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort, inaugurated thePlatform Studies series at MIT Press in 2009.We’ve coauthored a new book in the series, Codename: Revolution: the Nintendo Wii Video Game Console. Platform studies is a quintessentially Digital Humanities approach, since it’s explicitly focused on the interrelationship of computing and cultural expression. According to the series preface, the goal of platform studies is “to consider the lowest level of computing systems and to understand how these systems relate to culture and creativity.”In practice, this involves paying close attentionto specific hardware and software interactions--to the vertical relationships between a platform’s multilayered materialities (Hayles; Kirschenbaum),from transistors to code to cultural reception. Any given act of platform-studies analysis may focus for example on the relationship between the chipset and the OS, or between the graphics processor and display parameters or game developers’ designs.In computing terms, platform is an abstraction(Bogost and Montfort), a pragmatic frame placed around whatever hardware-and-software configuration is required in order to build or run certain specificapplications (including creative works). The object of platform studies is thus a shifting series of possibility spaces, any number of dynamic thresholds between discrete levels of a system.</p>",

When Paul and I first discussed the idea of writing an article about the subject several months ago, my first thought was that you--our cherished readers-might consider this whole notion so trivial as to not be worthy of a column that focuses mostly on scientific programming and software development topics. But based on the realization that we three computer scientists devote a significant part of our time to network and system administration, it almost goes without saying that networking is becoming more commonplace at home than at work.",

   "abstract": "<p>In this column, the authors look at Plone, which they feel is one of the best content management systems available today. Even better, it?s distributed under a free open-source license: the cost of getting started is only limited to the time you have available to set up the software on a server. Plone is written in Python and uses the Zope application server infrastructure; it runs on most modern operating systems. The authors have even set it up at Loyola University Chicago in the Department of Computer Science. Besides being two faculty members who rely on Plone to host all our Web content, they have recently customized Plone for their department?s public Web site (www.cs.luc.edu). The end result is a site on which content can be maintained entirely over the Web at zero cost to their department. Everything you see on their Web pages was generated by a unique combination of plaintext authoring, clever plug-ins, and a site-wide style.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>In this position paper, we provide a preliminary assessment of hardware and software solution stack choices available to developers of resource-oriented web services on commodity embedded devices. As part of an ongoing interdisciplinary research project on air and water quality in a major urban ecosystem, we are developing an information infrastructure amounting to a role-based hierarchy of individually addressable, interconnected resources, ranging from sensors, analyzers, and other monitoring devices to aggregators and publishers. This infrastructure follows the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern and integrates non-networked or non-RESTful monitoring devices through RESTful proxy resources running on low-cost, low-energy, possibly wireless, always-on embedded servers. Commodity wireless routers running a suitable embedded Linux distribution are a good choice for this purpose, and we have started to survey the landscape of supported solution stacks, including programming languages and RESTful frameworks: Not only were our preferred, familiar choices unavailable for medium-end routers, but we had to develop our own lightweight REST layer for lower-end routers. Given the growing popularity of embedded Linux devices, however, we argue that language designers and framework architects should support them to a much greater extent than they do now. In addition, as the demand for green computing grows, we argue that memory- and processor-efficient languages and frameworks become increasingly important.</p>",

Then, we identify the targeted department functions and their actors. Next, we describe the past and present technical architectures used to support these functions.

   "abstract": "<p>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) can be used as a portable, high-performance programming model for wide-area computing systems. The wide-area environment introduces challenging problems for the MPI implementor, due to the heterogeneity of both the underlying physical infrastructure and the software environment at different sites. In this article, we describe an MPI implementation that incorporates solutions to these problems. This implementation has beenconstructed by extending the Argonne MPICH implementation of MPI to use communicationservices provided by the Nexus communication library and authentication, resource allocation, process creation/management, and information services provided by the I-Soft system (initially) and the Globus metacomputing toolkit (work in progress). Nexus provides multimethod communication mechanisms that allow multiple communication methods to be used in a single computation with a uniform interface; I-Soft and Globus provided standard authentication,resource management, and process management mechanisms. We describe how these various mechanisms are supported in the Nexus implementation of MPI and present performance resultsfor this implementation on multicomputers and networked systems. We also discuss how more advanced services provided by the Globus metacomputing toolkit are being used to construct a second-generation wide-area MPI.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>Processing markup in object-oriented languages often requires the programmer to focus on the objects generating the markup rather than the more pertinent domain objects. The BetterXML framework aims to improve this situation by allowing the programmer to develop a domain-specific object model as usual and later bind this model to preexisting or newly generated markup. To this end, the framework provides two types of object trees, XElement and NaturalXML, for representing XML documents. XElement goes beyond DOM-like automatic parsing of XML by supporting the custom mapping of elements to domain objects; NaturalXML allows the mapping of existing domain objects to XML elements using class metadata. Both types of object trees can be inflated and deflated by means of a common intermediate representation in the form of an event stream. Finally, the framework includes the XML Intermediate Representation (XIR), a lossless record-oriented representation of XMLdocuments for efficient streaming and other types of data exchange.</p>",

While each layer of an OLFS volume constitutes a subvolume that can be mounted separately in a fan-in configuration, the entire hierarchy is always accessible (online) and fully navigable through any mounted layer. OLFS uses a relational database to store its layering metadata and either a relational database or any (virtual) host file system as its backing store, along with metadata and block caching for improved performance. Because OLFS runs as a virtual file system in user-space, its capabilities are available to all existing software without modification or special privileges. We have developed a reference implementation of OLFS for FUSE based on MySQL and XFS, and conducted performance benchmarking against XFS by itself. We explore several applications of OLFS, such as enhanced server synchronization, transactional file operations, and versioning.</p>",

In this article, we analyze requirements necessary for a telemedicine computing infrastructure and compare them with requirements found in a typical metacomputing environment. We will show that metacomputing environments can be used to enable a more powerful and unified computational infrastructure for telemedicine.

   "abstract": "<p>The broader context for this chapter comprises business scenarios requiring resource and/or service composition, such as (intra-company) enterprise application integration (EAI) and (inter-company) web service orchestration. The resources and services involved vary widely in terms of the protocols they support, which typically fall into remote procedure call (RPC)~\\citeBirrell84implementingremote, resource-oriented (HTTP~\\citeFielding96hypertexttransfer and WEBDAV~\\citewebdav) and message-oriented protocols. By recognizing the similarity between web-based resources and the kind of resources exposed in the form of filesystems in operating systems, we have found it feasible to map the former to the latter using a uniform, configurable connector layer. Once a remote resource has been exposed in the form of a local filesystem, one can access the resource programmatically using the operating system\\textquoterights standard filesystem application programming interface (API). Taking this idea one step further, one can then aggregate or otherwise orchestrate two or more remote resources using the same standard API. Filesystem APIs are available in all major operating systems. Some of those, most notably, all flavors of UNIX including GNU/Linux, have a rich collection of small, flexible command-line utilities, as well as various inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms. These tools can be used in scripts and programs that compose the various underlying resources in powerful ways. Further explorations of the role of a filesystem-based connector layer in the enterprise application architecture have lead us to the question whether one can achieve a fully compositional, arbitrarily deep hierarchical architecture by re-exposing the aggregated resources as a single, composite resource that, in turn, can be accessed in the same form as the original resources. This is indeed possible in two flavors: 1) the composite resource can be exposed internally as a filesystem for further local composition; 2) the composite resource is exposed externally as a restful resource for further external composition. We expect the ability hierarchically to compose resources to facilitate the construction of complex, robust resource- and service-oriented software systems, and we hope that concrete case studies will further substantiate our position.</p>",

In a nutshell, it involves the use of a network of computing resources to provide a comparatively economical package with capabilities once reserved for supercomputers. In this issue, we look at certain applications of cluster computing to problem solving. As the Beowulf project and clustering revolution celebrate more than 10 years in existence, it's interesting to see what remains the same and what has changed. Let's look at a few aspects of the clustering revolution in more detail.",

   "abstract": "<p>Large-scale scientific applications present great challenges to computational scientists in terms of obtaining high performance and in managing large datasets. These applications (most of which are simulations) may employ multiple techniques and resources in a heterogeneously distributed environment. Effective working in such an environment is crucial for modern large-scale simulations. In this paper, we present an integrated Java graphical user interface (IJ-GUI) that provides a control platform for managing complex programs and their large datasets easily. As far as performance is concerned, we present and evaluate our initial implementation of two optimization schemes: data replication and data prediction. Data replication can take advantage of 'temporal locality' by caching the remote datasets on local disks; data prediction, on the other hand, provides prefetch hints based on the datasets' past activities that are kept in databases. We first introduce the data contiguity concept in such an environment that guides data prediction. The relationship between the two approaches is discussed.</p>",

   "abstract": " <p>A great deal of emphasis on software technology to support scalable parallel processing is placed on von Neumann languages. One of two approaches is common: (a) augment the von Neumann language with explicit parallel constructs or (b) write super-optimizing compilers to “find” the parallelism in a von Neumann program. These two approaches appear to be useful at some level; however, this paper argues that software constructed using these approaches is not likely to scale very well, because an appropriate level of abstraction is not being used to solve the problem.</p>",

We model CN jobs using activity diagrams in any modeling tool with support for XMI, an XML-based external representation of UML models. We then export the activity diagrams and use our XSLT-based tool to transform the resulting XMI representation to CN job/task composition descriptors.",

We then provide details about our proposed model for incorporating PDC topics into our undergraduate curriculum. To this end, we have distilled a set of consistent, regularly offered and required three-week core and advanced PDC modules from our previously offered PDC content.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>Transparent access to remote data sets and data arising from web services is a non-trivial challenge to application developers. This early stage work addresses this challenge with NOFS, an object-oriented framework for creating filesystems to support domain specific functionality. While an early stage work, we present a solution to solve the access problem. Our solution greatly simplifies the task of filesystems development by providing the glue code needed between a domain model and the filesystem contract. We demonstrate support for domain models that are larger than physical memory and demonstrate how the concerns of caching can be removed from user-mode filesystem implementations. Future work will addresses more robust solutions to caching and other performance strategies.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>RNA-interference has potential therapeutic use against HIV-1 by targeting highly-functional mRNA sequences that contribute to the virulence of the virus. Empirical work has shown that within cell lines, all of the HIV-1 genes are affected by RNAi-induced gene silencing. While promising, inherent in this treatment is the fact that RNAi sequences must be highly specific. HIV, however, mutates rapidly, leading to the evolution of viral escape mutants. In fact, such strains are under strong selection to include mutations within the targeted region, evading the RNAi therapy and thus increasing the virus’ fitness in the host. Taking a phylogenetic approach, we have examined 4000+ HIV-1 strains obtained from NCBI’S database for each of the HIV genes, identifying conserved regions at each hypothetical and operational taxonomical unit within the tree. Integrating the wealth of information available from each genome’s record, we are able to observe how conserved regions vary with respect to their distribution throughout the world. This was made possible through the development of a new software tool, developed such that similar analyses can be conducted for any species or gene of interest, not just HIV-1. In addition to the phylogenetic signal which we can recognize from the HIV-1 genomes examined, we can also identify how selection varies across the genome. Taking this evolutionary approach, we have detected regions ideal for targeting by RNAi treatment.</p>",

In CS2, higher-order methods allow concise, efficient manipulation of collections. Advanced topics include domain-specific languages, concurrency, web apps/services, and mobile apps.

   "abstract": "<p>Userland filesystems (also known as virtual/installable filesystems) represent a promising direction for interfacing the traditional filesystem concept to specific domain instances (e.g. finance, bioinformatics, astronomy, photo sharing services, etc.) One might initially be inclined to think of filesystems as “old school” or “so 1980s” but their use remains an established practice in computational science and in many business domains, owing to the stability of filesystems interfaces and the continued perception of having great overall performance. While the promise of building one’s own userland filesystems is great, the approach has seen little adoption, owing to the complexity of working with low-level interfaces such as FUSE (Filesystems in User Space), which essentially require a complete mastery of Posix to build even the simplest filesystem.</p>",

   "abstract": " <p>In this talk, I will present work being done by the Pervasive Computing Group (with Joe Kaylor and Konstantin Läufer) at Loyola University Chicago on object-oriented frameworks to support the rapid creation and deployment of domain-specific userland filesystems. The focus will be on the Naked Objects Filesystem (NOFS), which supports the wiring of object oriented domain models to FUSE filesystems. (For details about the Naked Objects pattern, see <a href=\"http://downloads.nakedobjects.net/resources/Pawson%20thesis.pdf\">Pawson’s Ph.D. thesis</a>.) NOFS greatly simplifies the task of filesystems development by providing the glue code needed between a domain model and the filesystem contract. I’ll describe enhancements to the NOFS framework to support domain models that are larger than physical memory and demonstrate how the concerns of caching can be removed from user-mode filesystem implementations and placed into the NOFS framework. We illustrate how these new capabilities further simplify the development of user-mode filesystems. NOFS can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/nofs/\">http://code.google.com/p/nofs/.</a></p>",

   "abstract": "<p>\"Progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility of software at all levels\" (the overall premise of the workshop). We argue that true progress depends on embracing the best traditional--and emergent-- practices in software engineering, especially agile practices that intersect with the tradition of software engineering. Software engineering as practiced today is more than the stereotypical monolithic lifecycle processes (e.g. waterfall, spiral, etc.) that historically have impeded progress for small/medium sized development efforts. In addition, the discipline and practice of software engineering includes software quality (with an established tradition of software <em>metrics</em>). Software processes can be pragmatic and use best features/practices of various models without impeding developer productivity. The embracement of these practices may also be important to prevent a brain drain of sorts, as students are increasingly eschewing traditional scientific/computation science research in favor of industry opportunities, where they can literally apply what they have learned in software development courses where pragmatic software engineering practices (e.g. test-driven design, RESTful architecture, etc.) are already prevalent.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>Our work in software quality for digital humanities was borne of an effort to address sustainable practices in scientific software development, where the speaker (Thiruvathukal) co-authored a position paper on the case for software engineering in scientific software development as part of an all-encompassing strategy to create more sustainable scientific software (an example of a well-known scientific software package is LINPACK). In this position paper, we addressed how “progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility of software at all levels\". This progress depends on embracing the best traditional--and emergent--practices in software engineering, especially agile practices that intersect with the more formal tradition of software engineering. Although this paper was about scientific software development, it could just as easily have been about any interdisciplinary software development community. Our interest in applying what we’ve learned to DH, however, comes from work Thiruvathukal and Hayward have done and/or supervised in DH, especially WoolfOnline and a Richmond Times Dispatch viewer, where more software engineering could have been helpful.</p>",

   "abstract": "<p>As sequencing technologies continue to drop in price and increase in throughput, new challenges emerge for the management and accessibility of genomic sequence data. We have developed a pipeline for facilitating the storage, retrieval, and subsequent analysis of molecular data, integrating both sequence and metadata. Taking a polyglot approach involving multiple languages, libraries, and persistence mechanisms, sequence data can be aggregated from publicly available and local repositories. Data are exposed in the form of a RESTful web service, formatted for easy querying, and retrieved for downstream analyses. As a proof of concept, we have developed a resource for annotated HIV-1 sequences. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted for >6,000 HIV-1 sequences revealing spatial and temporal factors influence the evolution of the individual genes uniquely. Nevertheless, signatures of origin can be extrapolated even despite increased globalization. The approach developed here can easily be customized for any species of interest.</p>",
