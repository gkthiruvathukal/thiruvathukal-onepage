### Stop the Press!

I welcome media inquires. I enjoy speaking on technology in general, computer science research (including my own), and historical, social, ethical, and legal issues in computing.

Direct inquiries are welcome. Please contact [Justin Goldstein](justin.goldstein@finnpartners.com) and [Adam Zeiff](adam.zeiff@finnpartners.com) for inquiries in connection with my work at IEEE. You may also contact [Loyola University Chicago Media Relations Group](https://www.luc.edu/news/?utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=loyola-redirects&utm_source=newsroom).
