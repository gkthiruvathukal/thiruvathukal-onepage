## Current Research and Collaborations

I derive significant energy from research collaborations, both within and outside of my discipline, including both the humanities, sciences, and engineering. These form the basis for many of my current research projects and scholarly pursuits:

### Disciplinary Interactions

[Yung-Hsiang Lu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/ptProfile?resource_id=3355) (Purdue University) and I collaborate on **systems software to support computer vision at scale**. I am involved as co-PI and lead of **software engineering** in the [Purdue HELPS](https://www.purduehelps.org/) research group with specific focus on the [CAM2 Project](https://www.cam2project.net/).

[Venkat Vishwanath](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/staff-directory/venkatram-vishwanath), [Silvio Rizzi](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/staff-directory/silvio-rizzi) and [Xiaoyong Jin](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/staff-directory/xiao-yong-jin) (Argone National Laboratory), [François Tessier](http://www.francoistessier.info/) (ETH Zurich/CSCS), [Cameron Christensen](https://www.sci.utah.edu/people/cam.html) (SCI at University of Utah) and I collaborate on emerging runtimes for data science and engineering, focused on bringing **cloud computing frameworks to supercomputers**.  Silvio Rizzi, [Dario Dematties](https://github.com/dariodematties) (PhD Student, University of Buenos Aires), and I are collaborating on **biologically-inspired models of machine learning and artificial intelligence**.

[Jeffrey C. Carver](http://carver.cs.ua.edu/) (University of Alabama), [Nasir O. Eisty](https://neisty.github.io/) (PhD Student at University of Alabama) and I collaborate on **empirical software engineering**, specifically to understand and encourage best practices in scientific and research sofware development, including the [SE4Science](https://se4science.org/) initiative. Our focus is on the use of **software metrics** in research software development.

[Konstantin Läufer](http://laufer.cs.luc.edu/), [Nick Hayward](https://www.luc.edu/cs/people/ftfaculty/haywardnicholas.shtml), and I (all at Loyola University Chicago) collaborate on **tools for software engineering** and **mining software repositories** using an emerging [Metrics Dashboard](http://luc-metrics.herokuapp.com/).

[Ronald I. Greenberg](https://rig.cs.luc.edu/~rig/) and I collaborate in **computing education research**, focused on **robotics** at middle and high school levels.

### Interdisciplinary Interactions

In 2012, Steve E. Jones and I wrote a book about the Nintendo Wii in the [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/codename-revolution).

[David B. Dennis](https://www.luc.edu/history/people/facultyandstaffdirectory/facultybytheme/politics/dennisdavidb.shtml) (cultural historian at Loyola University Chicago as well) and I are working on a new **cutural history of computing** textbook for Taylor and Francis/CRC Press and **scholarly notetaking tools** via the [ZettelGeist](https://zettelgeist.com/) project.

[Gregory J. Matthews](https://statsinthewild.com/), [Juliet K. Brophy](https://lsu.edu/ga/people/faculty/juliet-k-brophy/index.php) , and [Ofer Harel](https://stat.uconn.edu/ofer-harel/) and I are collaborating the use of **statistical methods, machine learning, and crowdsourcing for shape analysis**, with a specific application to understanding the fossil record.

[David B. Wetzel](http://davidbrookewetzel.net/), [Griffin Moe](http://griffinmoe.com/), and I are collaborating on **electronic and digital music** software for accessible ensemble performance, which we use to run the [Loyola University Technology Ensemble](https://lute.luc.edu/). Come and join us sometime!
